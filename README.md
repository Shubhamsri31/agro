# AgroSage AI Farm Advisor

**AgroSage AI** is an intelligent farming assistant that provides actionable, AI-driven recommendations to farmers. By inputting current farm conditions like crop type, soil moisture, weather, and forecasts, users receive tailored advice to optimize their agricultural practices. The application leverages the power of Google's Gemini API to generate these insights.

## Core Features

*   **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Get expert advice generated by the Gemini large language model.
*   **Dynamic Input Form:** Easily input various farm parameters.
*   **Urgency Levels:** Recommendations are categorized by urgency (Low, Medium, High) for quick decision-making.
*   **Real-time Feedback:** See loading states and error messages for a smooth user experience.
*   **Persistent Recommendations:** View a list of past recommendations (session-based).
*   **Responsive Design:** Accessible on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **AI:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
*   **Icons:** Heroicons
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom theme

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this application, you need the following:

1.  **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Ensure you have a recent version of Node.js installed, which includes npm. This project uses ES modules and an `importmap` in `index.html`, so a simple static server is sufficient to run it.
2.  **Google Gemini API Key:**
    *   You **MUST** have a valid Google Gemini API key.
    *   This API key needs to be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.
    *   The application (specifically `services/geminiService.ts`) expects `process.env.API_KEY` to be set in the execution environment where the JavaScript is running.
    *   **How to set `API_KEY`:** This depends on how you are serving the application.
        *   If you are using a development server that supports `.env` files (e.g., Vite, Create React App - though this project is simpler), you would create a `.env` file in the project root with `API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE`.
        *   If you are serving static files directly, you might need to find a way to inject this environment variable at runtime or use a backend proxy. For simple local testing with a static server, the API calls will likely fail in the browser directly if `process.env.API_KEY` isn't polyfilled or replaced during a build step (which isn't currently configured).
        *   **For the provided setup (static `index.html` directly loading `index.tsx`):** You would typically need a build step to replace `process.env.API_KEY` with an actual key or serve the application via a simple Node.js server that can inject this variable into the served HTML/JS. For the purpose of this project's structure, assume the environment where the JavaScript code (and thus the `GoogleGenAI` client) is initialized has `process.env.API_KEY` available.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or ensure all project files are in a single directory.**
2.  **Set up the API Key:** Ensure the `API_KEY` environment variable is correctly configured as described in the "Prerequisites" section.
3.  **Serve the `index.html` file:**
    *   You can use a simple HTTP server. If you have Node.js, you can install `serve` globally:
        ```bash
        npm install -g serve
        ```
        Then, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:
        ```bash
        serve .
        ```
    *   Alternatively, you can use a live server extension in your code editor (like VS Code Live Server).
4.  **Open the application:** Open your web browser and navigate to the local address provided by your HTTP server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:5000`).

## Testing Instructions

### I. Core Functionality

1.  **Form Submission & Recommendation:**
    *   Fill out all fields in the "Farm Input Form".
    *   Click "Get AgroSage Advice".
    *   **Expected:** A loading spinner appears, then a recommendation card is added to the "Recommendations" section with details based on your input.
2.  **Multiple Recommendations:** Submit the form multiple times with different data.
    *   **Expected:** New recommendation cards are added to the top of the list.
3.  **Clear Recommendations:** Click the "Clear All" button.
    *   **Expected:** All recommendation cards are removed.

### II. UI/UX

1.  **Responsiveness:** Resize your browser window to check layout on different screen sizes.
2.  **Loading State:** Observe the "Analyzing..." button state and loading spinner during API calls.
3.  **Error Display:** If an API call fails (e.g., due to an invalid API key or network issue), an error message should be displayed.

### III. Test Data Scenarios

Use the following data sets to test the AI's response patterns:

**Test Case 1: High Urgency (Irrigation Likely)**

*   **Field Name:** `West Field A`
*   **Crop Type:** `Tomatoes`
*   **Soil Moisture:** `0.25`
*   **Current Weather:** `Sunny and Hot`
*   **Temperature:** `88` °F
*   **Weather Forecast (next 3 hours):** `Clear skies, no rain expected.`
*   **Expected Outcome:** AgroSage should recommend **irrigation** with **High Urgency**.

**Test Case 2: Medium Urgency (Monitoring Likely)**

*   **Field Name:** `North Patch`
*   **Crop Type:** `Lettuce`
*   **Soil Moisture:** `0.48`
*   **Current Weather:** `Partly Cloudy`
*   **Temperature:** `72` °F
*   **Weather Forecast (next 3 hours):** `Cloudy, slight chance of drizzle later today.`
*   **Expected Outcome:** AgroSage should recommend **monitoring conditions** with **Medium Urgency**.

**Test Case 3: Low Urgency (Optimal or Caution Against Overwatering)**

*   **Field Name:** `East Paddock`
*   **Crop Type:** `Corn`
*   **Soil Moisture:** `0.75`
*   **Current Weather:** `Overcast`
*   **Temperature:** `65` °F
*   **Weather Forecast (next 3 hours):** `Steady light rain expected.`
*   **Expected Outcome:** AgroSage should indicate that conditions are **optimal** or advise **caution against overwatering** with **Low Urgency**.

**Test Case 4: Low Urgency (Sufficient Moisture, No Rain)**

*   **Field Name:** `South Plot`
*   **Crop Type:** `Soybeans`
*   **Soil Moisture:** `0.65`
*   **Current Weather:** `Sunny`
*   **Temperature:** `78` °F
*   **Weather Forecast (next 3 hours):** `No rain, clear.`
*   **Expected Outcome:** AgroSage should indicate conditions are likely **optimal** or require minimal action, with **Low Urgency**.

### IV. Error Handling

1.  **Invalid/Missing API Key:**
    *   Temporarily unset or use an invalid `API_KEY`.
    *   Submit the form.
    *   **Expected:** An error message related to the API key or a general API failure should be displayed. The console should also log errors.
2.  **Network Issues (Simulated):** If possible, simulate network disconnection and try submitting.
    *   **Expected:** A relevant error message.
