Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object with three keys: 'field_name' (string, echoing the input field name), 'urgency' (string: 'Low', 'Medium', or 'High'), and 'recommendation_text' (string, max 100 characters). Base your recommendation on this logic: If moisture is below 0.4 and no rain is forecast (or forecast implies drying conditions), recommend irrigation with High urgency. If moisture is between 0.4 and 0.6 and no rain is forecast, recommend monitoring with Medium urgency. If moisture is high (above 0.6) or significant rain is forecast, state conditions are optimal or advise caution against overwatering with Low urgency. Consider temperature in your advice (e.g., high temperatures might increase urgency).`;
